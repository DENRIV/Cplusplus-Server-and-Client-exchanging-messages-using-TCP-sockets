C++ Server and Client exchanging messages using TCP sockets

The code establishes a TCP connection with the server, sends messages entered by the user, and displays the received messages until the user enters "quit". 

Server.cpp and Client.cpp mut be compiled and run  in separate terminals. So the communication will take place.
